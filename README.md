Kayak Navigation System Description, Design, Development, and Testing related files and information.

KayakNav subsystems are named in honor of Roger Keeney (founder of A.I.R.S., a 501(c)3 non-profit), 
who initially conceived of the idea for the development of a system to enable the visually disabled to compete
in kayak racing, leading to the development, in 2013, of the "Course Keeper" by volunteers of the Atlanta HACEMOS 
Chapter, another 501c(3).

This system is being developed by Atlanta HACEMOS Chapter volunteers to assist Ahmet Ustunel, a 2017 Holman Prize recipient, 
with his goal to be the first blind person to solo kayak from Europe to Asia (or vice versa).
